### 2. Define Scope

- What's nice to have (future)?
- What's explicitly out of scope?

### 3. Identify Constraints
- Timeline constraints?
- Technical constraints?
- Resource constraints?

### 4. Clarify Details
- What are the inputs/outputs?
- What are the edge cases?
- What are the error scenarios?

### 5. Validate Understanding
- Summarize back what you heard
- Confirm priorities
